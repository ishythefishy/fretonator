    Hi there! <span role="img" aria-label="waving emoji">👋🏼</span>
  </p>
  <h1 class="about__subtitle">Thanks for checking out the Fretonator!</h1>
  <p class="about__copy">
    I’m a qualified music teacher that (somehow) ended up working as a lead
    software engineer (it’s a long story) and now I work in Developer Relations.
    I built this for my husband
    <span role="img" aria-label="red heart emoji">❤️</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="about__copy">
    He’s a phenomenal guitarist, and over the past few years has worked on
    learning modes and scale theory for the guitar (with a little help from me).
    Obviously, the internet is great for this kind of stuff, but what he felt
    the world wide web was lacking was an interactive and informative tool he
    could use in his practice sessions that had
    <span class="italic">everything he needed on one single page</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="about__subtitle">Enter the Fretonator!</p>
  <p class="about__copy">
    The Fretonator is your new interactive tool for learning common modes on the
    guitar, understanding the chord theory behind the modes, and most
    importantly - <span class="italic">having a jam</span>.
